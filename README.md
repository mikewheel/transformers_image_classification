# Vision Transformers for Image Classification
Final project for DS4440: Practical Neural Networks, Fall 2020.

Project structure is as follows:
  - `implementation/`: the `transformer.ipynb` file contains the model implementations and experiments: in short,
    everything of importance for this project.
  - `final_project_report.pdf`: the writeup for the project.
  - `collection/`: scratch space for possibly scraping OpenImages data. Not included in the final results.
  - `data/`: directory for data assets as specified in `config.py`, included under `.gitignore`.
  - `writeup/`: source files for the writeup, done in LyX.
